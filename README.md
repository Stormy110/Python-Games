## Classes

### The pet_game file has the classes and class functions for the virtual pet game.


## Main
### The main file is the actual game. It is a virtual poet game similar to Tamagatchi games. You can choose 1 of 6 different kinds of pets. Then you have to keep the pet alive by feeding it, exercising it, and keeping it happy.

## Hangman
### There is also a small hangman game that does not use object oriented programming but it is  still kind of fun! 

## Programming Details
### I made a pet class with multiple attributes that act as "pet stats".
### I also made a function that holds the main menu of what you can do with the pets. There is also an initial menu where you choose a specific pet. Every time you do something for your pet, a "day" advances and the pet's stats change. You need to continuously cycle between feeding the pet, exercising it, and keeing t happy otherwise if it gets too fat, hungry or sad, it will die/run away. I added a clear function that allows the results of the action to aopear on the screen for 4 seconds and then clears the terminal.
